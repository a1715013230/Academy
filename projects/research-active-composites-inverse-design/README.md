# Research Project: Active Composites Inverse Design / Shape Morphing (ML-related)

This project folder centralizes:
- Literature search outputs (lists + PDF snapshots)
- Paper PDFs (ONLY if you have the rights; do not publish copyrighted PDFs)
- Research chat logs / notes

Structure
- `literature/` : paper lists (md/html/pdf)
- `chatlog/` : research-related chat notes (append-only)

Workflow (suggested)
- New research chats go into `chatlog/`.
- New literature batches go into `literature/` with date-stamped files.
